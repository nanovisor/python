BURN-E (stylized with an interpunct as BURN·E) is a computer animated short created by Pixar in 2008. It is a parallel spin-off from the feature-length movie WALL-E. A repair robot named BURN-E is a minor character from the movie, and the film is intercut with scenes from WALL-E, which takes place concurrently.[1][2] WALL-E's director Andrew Stanton acted as co-writer and executive producer on BURN-E.

BURN-E was produced at the same time as WALL-E and was directed by the feature film's lead animator, Angus MacLane.[3] The short movie is included as bonus material to the DVD and Blu-ray releases of WALL-E[4][5][6] and has since also been aired on TV.[7] BURN-E features music composed and conducted by J.A.C. Redford, who was also orchestrator on the film WALL-E.[8][9]
